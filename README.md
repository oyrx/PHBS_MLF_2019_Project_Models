This repo contains some pre-trained models of project [PHBS_MLF_2019_Project
](https://github.com/oyrx/PHBS_MLF_2019_Project):

- Logistic Regession
- Random Forest
- GBDT in XGBoost
- GBDT / DART models in LightGBM

Parameters are in `.txt` files, confusion matrixs are in `.png` files, and dumped models are `.model` files, which can be loaded again using a standar module in Python: [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).

Considering file size, dumped random forest model and neural models are ignored when uploading.
